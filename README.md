### Project Description
The Find My Guru webpage is a platform where users can search for faculty members by name or department and view their details in a table format, including name, department, availability (with color-coded status: green for available, red for unavailable), and current location (e.g., HOD Room, Labs). It offers a user-friendly interface with dynamic search functionality, helping students or others quickly locate and connect with teachers.

### The Problem statement
The problem is to develop a web-based system that allows users to search for faculty members by name or department, view their availability and location in real-time, and easily navigate through the available faculty information. The goal is to provide a streamlined, efficient way for students and staff to locate and connect with teachers based on their availability and departmental allocation.

### The Solution
The solution is a web application that enables users to search for faculty members by name or department and display their details, including availability (color-coded as green for available and red for unavailable), department, and current location (e.g., HOD Room, Labs). The system offers a dynamic search feature, presenting the results in a table format, and is designed to be accessible, user-friendly, and responsive, helping students and staff easily locate and interact with faculty based on their real-time availability.
